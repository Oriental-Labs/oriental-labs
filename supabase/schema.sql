  'How we designed and built the Oriental Labs website — from tech choices to deployment.',
  E'# Building a modern portfolio studio site with Next.js\n\nAt Oriental Labs, we practice what we preach. When it was time to build our own studio site, we treated it like any client project: scoped requirements, chose a deliberate stack, and shipped.\n\n## Why Next.js?\n\nNext.js 15 with the App Router gave us everything we needed: static generation for fast page loads, server components for metadata and SEO, and seamless Vercel deployment.\n\n## Design philosophy\n\nWe kept the palette simple — a deep navy background, electric blue accents, and clean white type. Inspired by Linear, Vercel, and Stripe. No gradients for the sake of it, no hero images that slow things down.\n\n## Framer Motion for subtle animation\n\nWe used `framer-motion` sparingly — viewport-triggered fade-ins and staggered card entrances. The goal was *felt* rather than *seen*.\n\n## Internationalization without a library\n\nThe site supports Spanish and English, auto-detected from `navigator.language`. We wrote a tiny context-based i18n system (~60 lines) instead of pulling in a 50kb library.\n\n## Deployment\n\nVercel. Zero config. Done.',

  E'# Lessons from integrating AI into real products\n\nAfter shipping AI features into several production apps, we have a few hard-won lessons to share.\n\n## 1. Latency is a UX problem first\n\nStreaming responses with the Vercel AI SDK transformed the feel of our chat interfaces. Users tolerate slow AI if they see progress — a blank screen for 3 seconds is unacceptable.\n\n## 2. Prompt engineering is engineering\n\nTreating prompts as code — versioned, tested, and reviewed — made our outputs dramatically more consistent. We now keep prompts in source control alongside the components that render them.\n\n## 3. Guard against hallucinations at the boundary\n\nDon''t let raw LLM output touch your database without a schema validation layer. We use Zod to parse structured outputs before writing anything.\n\n## 4. Cost scales with misuse\n\nRate limiting and token budgets per user prevented runaway API costs. Monitor your token usage from day one.\n\n## Closing thought\n\nAI is a powerful lever, but a lever still needs a machine around it. The software engineering fundamentals — clean architecture, error handling, observability — matter more than ever.',
